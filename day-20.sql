-- Question:
-- Jack Frost wants to review all the cocoa breaks he actually took — including the cocoa type and the location he drank it in. How would you combine the necessary tables to show each logged break with its matching cocoa details and location?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: cocoa_logs
--   log_id: INT
--   break_id: INT
--   cocoa_id: INT
--
-- Table: break_schedule
--   break_id: INT
--   location_id: INT
--
-- Table: cocoa_types
--   cocoa_id: INT
--   cocoa_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: locations
--   location_id: INT
--   location_name: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

select s.break_id,t.cocoa_name,Ll.location_name
from break_schedule s
join cocoa_logs l 
on s.break_id = l.break_id
join cocoa_types t
on l.cocoa_id = t.cocoa_id 
join locations Ll
on s.location_id = Ll.location_id
